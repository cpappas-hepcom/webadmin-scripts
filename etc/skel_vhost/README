Hep Communications - Development Hosting
----------------------------------------

Welcome to your new virtual hosting development account!

This account does not have the ability to log in via SSH, or to create SSH tunnels,
but it will have the ability to log in and upload/download files via FTP.

All of your web files should go into the public_html directory (the www directory is
an alias or "symbolic link" to public_html).

Apache web access logs can be found in the 'access_logs' directory.

If you have any questions, please contact the Server Administrator:
