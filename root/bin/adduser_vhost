## Adduser Script for a Hep Communications Virtual Host
##
##	By: Chris Pappas <cpappas@hepcom.ca>
##	Last Updated: April 30, 2010 15:51
##	Version: 0.3
##
##	Usage: /root/bin/adduser_vhost <username>
##
##	Creates the user using adduser with the custom adduser.conf.vhost file
##	The password and all GECOS data must be specified manually
##
## 	This gives us safer defaults like /usr/sbin/nologin shells, and will give
##		them user/group ids between 5000 and 6000.
##	It also copies the skeleton files from /etc/skel_vhost
##
##	TODO:
##		Add support for automatically creating the fcgid wrapper scripts
##		Add support for auto creating their apache2/sites-available vhost def
##			Don't want to enable this right away though!
##

## check to ensure that the username has been specified
if [ -z $1 ]; then
	echo "Usage: $0 user-name" 1>&2
	exit 1
fi

## create the new user and check to see if it worked
## if not then exit this script

echo "Creating New User: $1"

## generate a series of passwords to choose from
pwgen -sB 16

adduser --conf /etc/adduser.conf.vhost --gecos $1 $1
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
	echo "Error! $0 failed" 1>&2
	exit 1
fi

## here is where the stuff for setting up fcgid wrappers will go
## as well as the apache stuff
## also any assorted other goodies can go here as well


## copy the fcgi starter scripts to a new directory
## with the user name and then chown them so the new user owns them

echo "Making new php-fcgi-scripts folder"

mkdir -p /var/www/php-fcgi-scripts/$1/
cp /var/www/php-fcgi-scripts/skel_vhost/* /var/www/php-fcgi-scripts/$1/
chown -R $1 /var/www/php-fcgi-scripts/$1/
chgrp -R $1 /var/www/php-fcgi-scripts/$1/


## the fcgi scripts have now been created
## now let's create the apache2 sites-available vhost definition

echo "Making new apache2 vhost definition"

cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/_skel_vhost /etc/apache2/sites-available/$1
sed -i "s/{vhost_user}/$1/g" /etc/apache2/sites-available/$1
sed -i "s/{vhost_group}/$1/g" /etc/apache2/sites-available/$1

## we are now finished!
## the user has been created successfully

echo "User $1 created successfully. Run 'a2ensite $1' to enable their development site."
echo "Then, run 'service apache2 reload' to reload the configuration and make the site available"

exit 0
